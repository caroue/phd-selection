#data: softlink the fasta file which contains the CDS for all proteins of all species into data/
#important: the fasta headers need to contain the species ID and the ":" after "transcript" (which is created by gffread when extracting CDS from nucleotide fasta with .gff file) replaced by a "_" for the alignment with MACSE to work
